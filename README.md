👋 Hi, I'm Jeyanthi Thiagarajan, passionate about Machine Learning / AI & Data Science with over 15 years of experience in the tech industry, including 5+ years focused on Machine Learning, AI, and Data Science. I'm currently working at NextGenisys, blending my expertise in software development with my deep knowledge of Data Science and AI.

🌟 I specialize in developing, deploying, and monitoring & maintaining Machine Learning Models, and I'm constantly exploring advanced AI tools to enhance business outcomes. I have a keen interest in collaborating with commercial businesses and contributing to impactful projects that leverage data to solve real-world problems.

🔍 My journey began as a Technical Lead and Senior Consultant, and I later transitioned into Data Science and Machine Learning. This hybrid background gives me a unique perspective on both the engineering and data aspects of the tech world.

🚀 I'm always learning and evolving with the latest technologies in Python, Data Science, and AI. Check out my Tableau Data Visualizations to see some of the work I’ve been doing:
